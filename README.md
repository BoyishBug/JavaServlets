# Java Web Project using Servlets

Final Java Project for IT 214

## Overview

This web project was made to be a run of the mill math website that would allow
you to do basic math using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
We implemented arrays to allow you to sort the array the user inputs and as well
as allow the person to search to see if a number was in that array. Later we added 
a factorial page that would allow the user to find tha factorial of the inputted number.
Finally we added a queue page that adds the numbers to a queue and sorts it in
numerical order. Then it would return back the first two numbers of the queue
and multiply them and add them together.

## Implemented Features

* Recursive Methods (Factorial, Multiplication, and Addition)
* Searching Method (Binary Search)
* Sorting Methods
* Calculator Method (Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction, and Division)
* Queue Method

## To-Do
* Deploy login page
* Provide better documentation
* Implement all sorting methods with timer
* Add ability to upload custom CVS files to be used with the sorting & searching servlets
* edit HTML maybe add CCS to make the website prettier
