				Java Web Project
			============================

1. Overview

This web project was made to be a run of the mill math website that would allow
you to do basic math using addition, subtraction, mulitplication, and division.
We implemented arrays to allow you to sort the array the user inputs and as well
as allow the person to search to see if a number was in that array. Later we added 
a factorial page that would allow the user to find tha factorial of the inputed number.
Finally we added a queue page that adds the numbers to a queue and sorts it in
numerical order. Then it would return back the first two numbers of the queue
and multiply them and add them together.
